# 🔄 Real-World SOC Workflow

This explains how security monitoring works in a real organization.

## 🖥 Step 1: Log Collection

Systems generate logs from:
- Servers
- Firewalls
- Antivirus
- Applications
- Network devices

These logs are sent to a SIEM system.

---

## 📊 Step 2: SIEM Analysis

The SIEM:
- Collects logs
- Correlates events
- Generates alerts based on rules

Example:
Multiple failed logins → Alert generated

## 🔔 Step 3: Alert Review (L1 Analyst)

L1 SOC analyst:
- Reviews the alert
- Checks logs
- Identifies false positives
- Escalates if necessary

---

## 🔎 Step 4: Investigation (L2 Analyst)

If suspicious:
- Deep log analysis
- Check IP reputation
- Identify attacker behavior
- Confirm incident

---

## 🚨 Step 5: Response & Containment

Actions may include:
- Blocking IP address
- Isolating infected machine
- Resetting passwords

---

## 📑 Step 6: Documentation

SOC documents:
- What happened
- Timeline
- Impact
- Preventive actions

---

## 🔁 Continuous Monitoring

After resolution:
- Systems are monitored again
- Detection rules are improved

---

## ✅ Summary

Logs → SIEM → Alert → Investigation → Response → Documentation → Improvement

This is the daily workflow inside a SOC.
