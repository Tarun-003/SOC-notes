# 🚨 Alert vs Incident in SOC

Understanding the difference between an alert and an incident is very important for SOC Analysts.

## 🔔 What is an Alert?

An alert is a notification generated by a security tool when something suspicious is detected.

Examples:
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Malware detected by antivirus
- Unusual network traffic

Alert does NOT always mean an attack.

## 🔥 What is an Incident?

An incident is a confirmed security threat that can harm systems, data, or users.

Examples:
- Successful unauthorized access
- Malware infection confirmed
- Data breach

Incident requires immediate action.

## 📊 Key Differences

| Alert | Incident |
|------|---------|
| Suspicious activity | Confirmed attack |
| Needs investigation | Needs response |
| May be false positive | Real security issue |

## ✅ Simple Example

10 failed logins → Alert  
Account hacked → Incident

## 🧠 Summary

Alert = warning sign  
Incident = real threat

SOC analysts investigate alerts to find real incidents.
