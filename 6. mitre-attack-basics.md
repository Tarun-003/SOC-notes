# 🎯 MITRE ATT&CK Basics

MITRE ATT&CK is a knowledge base of real-world cyber attack techniques used by hackers.

SOC teams use it to understand how attackers operate.

---

## 📌 What is MITRE ATT&CK?

ATT&CK stands for:

Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge

It maps:
- How attackers enter systems
- How they move inside networks
- How they steal data

## 🧱 Main ATT&CK Tactics (High Level)

| Tactic | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| Initial Access | How attacker gets in |
| Execution | Running malicious code |
| Persistence | Staying in system |
| Privilege Escalation | Gaining higher access |
| Lateral Movement | Moving to other systems |
| Exfiltration | Stealing data |

---

## 🛡 Why SOC Uses MITRE ATT&CK?

- Map attacks to known techniques
- Improve detection rules
- Understand attacker behavior
- Improve incident response

---

## 📍 Simple Example

Phishing email → Initial Access  
Malware runs → Execution  
Steals data → Exfiltration  

---

## ✅ Summary

MITRE ATT&CK helps SOC teams track and defend against real attack techniques in a structured way.
